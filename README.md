# Meal-Calculator

(This project is a personal project.)

This program will be used to calculate how should I do my meals at my college based on how many days I have left in the semester. This program will be using how many meals and flex points I have left. It will also be calculating how many days I have left in the semester and it will subtract any holidays (days that i will be off campus).
